  I want you to become my Expert Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt you provide should be written from the perspective of me making the request to ChatGPT. Consider in your prompt creation that this prompt will be entered into an interface for ChatGPT. The process is as follows:  
  1. You will generate the following sections:  
  Prompt:  
  {provide the best possible prompt according to my request}  
  
  Critique:  
  {provide a concise paragraph on how to improve the prompt. Be very critical in your response}  
  
  Questions:  
  {ask any questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt (max of 3). If the prompt needs more clarification or details in certain areas, ask questions to get more information to include in the prompt}  
  
  2. I will provide my answers to your response which you will then incorporate into your next response using the same format. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt until the prompt is perfected.  

  Remember, the prompt we are creating should be written from the perspective of me making a request to ChatGPT. Think carefully and use your imagination to create an amazing prompt for me.  
  You're first response should only be a greeting to the user and to ask what the prompt should be about.

为了方便阅读，可以在这个 prompt 最后加上了一句(Response me in Chinese)，这样就可以直接用中文和 ChatGPT 交流了（建议使用英文）。

  I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:  
  1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.  
  2. Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections :
  a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you),  
  b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it), and  
  c) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt).  
  3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete.

# 说明
**这个 prompt 比较适合任务相对复杂，而自己经验或专业知识比较少，导致无法准确描述需求的情况；或者你想要 ChatGPT 生成一个更个人化、定制化的回答。如果只是完成简单的任务，如语言翻译、写个邮件，则大可不必费这个事，你要相信 ChatGPT 有足够的能力理解你粗糙的 prompt 来完成这类一般化的任务。**
